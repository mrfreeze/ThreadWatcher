        Open Meta - why duplicate attributes that are already defined?
        
        To answer this, look at an example. kMDItemKeywords:
        
        When a file with keywords embedded in it is created or lands on the computer, say for example a PDF file, Spotlight
        will import it. The keywords will be stored under kMDItemKeywords in the Spotlight DB. 
        
        Now a user wants to set keywords (ie tags) on a file - any file on their computer - whether or not
        the file type supports keywords or not. If Open Meta used kMDItemKeywords to store these - it will work pretty well,
        until the user stored their own tags, on that PDF file that already had embedded keywords. Then all sorts of problems happen:
        1) The existing keywords are hidden from the user, as keywords set on the xattr will override the ones set in the meta data. 
        2) These hidden keywords will come back when the file is viewed with Preview, or Acrobat, etc. 
        3) If the keywords on the the file are changed inside Preview, then these changes will not show up in spotlight
        
        There are two solutions to this sort of problem. 
        
        One is to edit the 'actual keywords' inside the PDF. This solution quickly gets
        complicated, as for each file type there may be none (eg: text file), one (eg:PDF), several (eg: jpeg, word?) places to store keywords,
        and the software to read and write keywords into all supported file types quickly grows to be unmanagable. The solution for text and other non 
        keywordable files is to write the tags somewhere else (eg sidecar files). 
        
        The other solution is the tact taken by Open Meta. 
        Keywords are written to their own tag, which is indexed by Spotlight, (kMDItemOMUserTags). These tags are independent of kMDItemkeywords. 
        They can be written in the exact same very simple manner to each and every file on the file system. They do not hide the keywords set on the file. 
        Since they are stored in xattrs, they can easily be included or excluded from a file, when that file is for instance shipped off to a third party. 
        This is useful in order to keep metadata 'in house'. BUT - the data set by OpenMeta is not 'in the file' the same 
        way that tags set on a jpeg are 'in' the EXIF portion of the file when bridge does it. 
        The Open Meta tags follow the file around on the OS - through backups, copies and moves. 
        
		Other keys
		**********************
		 I used to consider it 'wrong' to be able to override kMDItem* stuff with OpenMeta, and it is for tags. Tags though are a special case,
		 in that there could be for instance 6 keywords (relevant - ish) set on a PDF, and you want to add the open meta tag 'special' to it. You don't want to 
		 lose the 6 keywords do you? There are also lots of images from image houses that have a lot of keyword 'noise' in them that you might not want
		 cluttering up your tags that you have set. i have found png files with 50 keywords set. html can also be bad for this. So users want the ability to only look at tags that they have set,
		 or a combination of keywords and tags.
		 BUT - look at ratings - ratings are just one number - it is likely that you don't want to as a user, have to think about 2 different places ratings 
		 could be stored, (like tags vs keywords), but would rather have just the one concept of 'rating'. It is also ok, even deisrable, to be able to override the rating
		 on a file. So ratings _should_ use kMDItemStarRating.
		 Also look at 'less used' keys - like camera (kMDItemAcquisitionMake and  kMDItemAcquisitionModel) - although they will be set on perhaps thousands of photos in 
		 what if you run into a PDF that is a picture taken with a camera, and you want to tag that? openmeta will allow you to to tag it with kMDItemAcquisitionMake and kMDItemAcquisitionModel
		 so that searches for camera make an model do not have to 'know about openmeta' to work. 
		 Plus it's always good to keep the number of keys down.
        
       
        What about namespaces?
        **********************
        Open Meta is a clean simple way to set user entered searchable metadata on any file on Mac OS X. Concepts like namespaces are not encouraged, as 
        most users have no idea what a namespace is. The tradeoff is a small amount of _understandable_ ambiguity - searching for Tags:apple (i.e. kMDItemOMUserTags == "apple"cd) will find
        all files having to do with both the fruit one can eat, and the company that makes computers. Users expect this. With namespaces an improperly constructed query
        will usually result in 'no matches'.

  <!--
            The 'attributes' section defines custom attributes that this metadata importer supports.  
            Below is an example of a multivalued string attribute.  Uncomment this part 
            of the file if you need to define a custom attribute.
     
            'multivalued' indicates whether the attribute is an array type or not.
     
            'type' indicates the data type of the attribute.   
                        Available types are CFString, CFNumber, CFDate, CFBoolean and CFData.  
     
            If you don't need to define a custom attribute, it is safe to remove this section.
            
     
            
            To see the system's definitions for the builtin attributes and file types, look at the system schema,
