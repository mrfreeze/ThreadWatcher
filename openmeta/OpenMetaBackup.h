Backing up xattr:

Extended Attributes are supposed to 'not dissapear' they are connected to a file. When a user does a 'save' on a file, the default unix and cocoa apis will 
preserve all the xattrs. BUT there are applications (notably Adobe CS 4 products, like Photoshop) which do a save in such a way as to wipe out all xattrs on each file 
at each save. Not good. Also when using tools like subversion, etc where files are downloaded from the internet, xattrs can be easily lost. 

So OpenMeta makes a backup file for every edit to xattrs when using the API. 

The exact details may change in the future, the idea though is that when we go to retrieve tags for a file, if we find no tags, we check to see if there is a 
backup file we can restore from. If no backup file, then there really are no tags on the file. 

The backups are stored in the home folder of the person who made the change to the file, in ~/Library/OpenMeta/backups.noindex. This works well for most usage scenarios, 
but with network volumes or mobile volumes, it may be better to store the backups in a predetermined place on the volume.

// ---------------------------
// call this to restore all backed up meta data. Call when? On every launch is likely too much.

// it does run in a thread, though..
